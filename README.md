    - Abstractly speaking, a landing zone helps you plan for and design an Azure deployment, by conceptualizing a designated area for placement and integration of resources. There are two types of landing zones:
    1. `platform landing zone`: provides centralized enterprise-scale foundational services for workloads and applications.
    2. `application landing zone`: provides services specific to an application or workload.

    <summary>Architecture Styles vs Patterns vs Design Patterns</summary>

        𝟭. 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝘁𝘆𝗹𝗲𝘀

        This is the highest level of abstraction, where architectural designs instruct us on structuring our code. The highest level of granularity describes the application's layers and high-level modules and how they relate to and interact with one another. Examples of architectural styles include:
        🔹 Monolith
        🔹 Layered
        🔹 Event-driven
        🔹 Self-contained Systems
        🔹 Microservices
        🔹 Space-Based

        𝟮. 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀

        These patterns represent a way to implement an architectural style, so we can do this regularly. Some examples are how to separate the user interface (UI) and data, how internal modules interact, and what layers we will use. Patterns answer these types of questions. They usually impact the code base and how to structure the code inside. Examples of architectural patterns include:

        🔹 Model-View-Presenter (MVP): 1:1 Relationship between View and Presenter. e.g., Windows forms
        🔹 Model-View-Controller (MVC): e.g., Smalltalk, ASP.Net MVC
        🔹 Model–View–Viewmodel (MVVM): One to Many relationship between View and ViewModel. e.g., Silverlight, WPF, AngularJs: 
        🔹 Domain-Driven Design

        𝟯. 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀

        These differ from architectural patterns in that they focus on a smaller code base area and have a smaller influence (focus on a local problem). These include limiting the creation of a class to only one object or notifying all dependent objects when the internal state of an object is changed. These patterns are described in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides from 1994.

        We have 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀:

        🔹 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹: here we have Factory Method, Builder, Singleton, ...
        🔹 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹: here we have an Adapter, Bridge, and Decorator, ...
        🔹 𝗕𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹: here we have Command, Iterator, State, Strategy, ...

- Memory consistency model: [A Primer on Memory Consistency and Cache Coherence](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-01764-3)

    <details>

    <summary>SC vs TSO vs Relaxed Memory Consistency</summary>

        𝟭. Sequential Consistency (SC): Operations execute in order as per the program.
        🔹 SC preserves order for two memory operations from the same thread for all four combinations of loads and stores (Load → Load, Load → Store, Store → Store, and Store → Load). 
        🔹 MIPS R10000

        𝟮. Total Store Order (TSO): Reads can happen before preceding writes complete. 
        🔹 TSO preserves the first three orders (Load → Load, Load → Store, Store → Store) but not Store → Load order.
        🔹 x86 CPU.
    
        𝟯. Relaxed Memory Consistency: Allows more reordering of operations for performance. 
        🔹 ARM and RISC-V

- API Gateway vs Load Balancer
  - API Gateway: Manages access to backend services, handles tasks like rate-limiting, authentication, logging, and security policies.
  - Load Balancer: Distributes network traffic across multiple servers for high availability and even load distribution.

    <summary>SOAP, RestAPI, GraphQL, gRPC and Kafka</summary>

    🔹SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): XML-based protocol for web services, heayweight, favored for security and reliability.

    🔹REST (Representational State Transfer): Uses HTTP methods, simple and easy to use, but can be resource-heavy.

    🔹GraphQL: Allows flexible data queries, reduces data over-fetching.

    🔹gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**: High-performance RPC framework, ideal for connecting microservices. Built on top of HTTP/2 and uses Protocol Buffers for data exchange.

    🔹Kafka: Distributed streaming platform, uses publish-subscribe model for message queueing. real-time consistency. "at-least-once" delivery.

    <details>

    <summary>MQTT vs AMQP vs WebSocket</summary>

    🔹MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport): Lightweight messaging protocol, uses publish-subscribe model, ideal for IoT and M2M communication. Three levels of Quality of Service (QoS): “At most once” (QoS 0), “At least once” (QoS 1), and “Exactly once” (QoS 2).

    🔹AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol): Open-standard application layer protocol, robust message delivery, routing, and security features. Two qualities of service: “At most once (delivered once or lost)” and “At least once (delivered one or more times.)”.

    🔹WebSocket: Enables full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection

- Reactive programming vs event-driven architecture [ref](https://reactiveweb.org/reactive-programming-vs-event-driven-key-differences/)
  - Event-Driven: Handles user actions or system events. More general and can be used in any context where an event occurs
  - Reactive: Data-driven approach. managing data streams and propagating changes, like in a spreadsheet model.

- RABC vs ReABC: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is an authorization model that assigns permissions based on predefined roles. On the other hand, ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control) extends RBAC’s capabilities by considering relationships between entities.
- Conway's law: Software engineering principle that states that the structure of a system reflects the structure of the organization that designs it.
- Data Management in Distributed systems (Partitioning, Shuffling and Bucketing)

    <details>

    <summary>Partitioning vs Shuffling vs Bucketing</summary>

    🔹Partitioning: The process of dividing a large dataset into smaller parts, known as partitions. This process splits Hive table's files into multiple files. For example, `../hive/warehouse/sales_table/product_id=P1`.

    🔹Shuffling: Shuffling is the process of redistributing data across different partitions. The overhead of operations can be ranked as follows: `orderby` > `join` > `groupby`.

    🔹Bucketing: This is the process of decomposing data into manageable parts based on a certain column, thereby improving query performance and storage efficiency. It is best used when there are very few repeating values in a column (for example - a primary key column). For instance, Bucket0: `../hive/warehouse/sales_table/product_id=P1/000000_0`, Bucket1: `../hive/warehouse/sales_table/product_id=P1/000001_0`, and so on.

- SSO (Single Sign-On) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.

    <details>

    <summary>SSO workflow, Types of SSO, SSO Implementations</summary>

    🔹SSO workflow: Identity Provider (IdP), Service Provider (SP), SSO Server
    - IdP: Central Authentication server e.g., Google
    - SP: Individual Applications rely on SSO e.g, Trello
    - SSO Server: Bridge between IdP and SPs

    🔹Types of SSO: SAML, OAuth (Open Authorization) 2.0, Open ID Connect (OIDC)

    | Protocol | Purpose | Token Format | - |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | OAuth 2.0 | Open standard for Authorization | Access Tokens | Temporary access to 3rd party app |
    | OpenID Connect (OIDC) | Open standard for Authentication | JSON Web Token (JWT) | Newer type of SSO based on OAuth 2.0, Straightforward protocol than SAML |
    | SAML | Authentication, Authorization | XML | Most common, Use SAML Protocol to exchange authentication between SSO server and SP |

    🔹Some other Types of SSO: Kerberos, Smart card authentication
    - Kerberos: Less suitable for internet-facing SSO due to the shared secret between KDC (Key Distributin Center) and all participants.
    - Smart card authentication: Physical card

    🔹SSO Implementations: Microsoft Entra ID (FKA Micorsoft Active Directory), Okta, Ping Identity, OneLogin, Auth0

- Deployment Styles: Blue/Green, Canary, and A/B

    <details>

    <summary>Blue/Green, Canary, A/B</summary>

    🔹Blue/Green Deployment: Two identical environments, "Blue" and "Green". Deploy new version in inactive environment, test, then switch users to it. For example, AWS supports blue/green deployment strategies including Elastic Beanstalk, OpsWorks, CloudFormation, CodeDeploy, and Amazon ECS.

    🔹Canary Deployment: Roll out new version to a small group of users, monitor feedback, then do a full-scale release.

    🔹A/B Testing: Compare two versions of a webpage or app to see which performs better. A typical example of A/B testing is website usability testing.

- Flaky Test: A Flaky Test is a test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails, despite no changes in the code. Causes can include poorly written tests, async waits, test order dependency, and concurrency issues. They can slow down CI/CD pipelines and cause issues for end users.

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Application layer - routing, load balancing, etc] -->|Northbound APIs| B[Control layer - SDN controller]
        B -->|Southbound APIs| C[Infrastructure layer - physical switches, data plane]
    ```

    🔹The **Controller** is the SDN network's brain, directing traffic flows.

    🔹 The **Southbound Interface** communicates the controller's decisions to the switches using protocols like OpenFlow.

    🔹**SDN Switches** direct traffic based on the controller's instructions.

    🔹**Network Devices** (servers, routers, etc.) send and receive data flows as directed by the SDN switches.

    🔹The **Northbound Interface** uses APIs to exchange data between the controller and applications.

    🔹**SDN Applications** use network data to perform tasks, communicating their needs to the controller.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    A[Controller] -- API --> B[Southbound Interface]
