    <summary>Architecture Styles vs Patterns vs Design Patterns</summary>

        𝟭. 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝘁𝘆𝗹𝗲𝘀

        This is the highest level of abstraction, where architectural designs instruct us on structuring our code. The highest level of granularity describes the application's layers and high-level modules and how they relate to and interact with one another. Examples of architectural styles include:
        🔹 Monolith
        🔹 Layered
        🔹 Event-driven
        🔹 Self-contained Systems
        🔹 Microservices
        🔹 Space-Based

        𝟮. 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀

        These patterns represent a way to implement an architectural style, so we can do this regularly. Some examples are how to separate the user interface (UI) and data, how internal modules interact, and what layers we will use. Patterns answer these types of questions. They usually impact the code base and how to structure the code inside. Examples of architectural patterns include:

        🔹 Model-View-Presenter (MVP)
        🔹 Model-View-Controller (MVC)
        🔹 Model–View–Viewmodel (MVVM)
        🔹 Domain-Driven Design

        𝟯. 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀

        These differ from architectural patterns in that they focus on a smaller code base area and have a smaller influence (focus on a local problem). These include limiting the creation of a class to only one object or notifying all dependent objects when the internal state of an object is changed. These patterns are described in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides from 1994.

        We have 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀:

        🔹 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹: here we have Factory Method, Builder, Singleton, ...
        🔹 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹: here we have an Adapter, Bridge, and Decorator, ...
        🔹 𝗕𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹: here we have Command, Iterator, State, Strategy, ...
